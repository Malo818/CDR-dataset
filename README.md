## 📁 Dataset Structure

The dataset includes a main folder:

- `Concrete defect recognition/`
  
  This folder contains 12 subfolders, each representing one type of concrete surface defect. Examples include:
  
  - `Airhole/`: Contains images of airhole defects.
  - `Crack/`: Contains images of surface cracks.
